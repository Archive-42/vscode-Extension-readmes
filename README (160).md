## Theme Compatibility

Highlighting is compatible with all themes, but the visual experience will be affected by the theme.

Main development environment was under [Flatland Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-FlatlandMonokai).

And we review the visual experience under: Dark, OneDarkPro, Monokai, Electron

There also a specialized theme for TOML: [Nyx](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Aster.nyx-theme)

## Limitation
The plugin only provide static lexical highlighting, so it can't find all the invaild inputs.
