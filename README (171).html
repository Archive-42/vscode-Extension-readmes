<p>This tool, although currently usable to an extent, is by no means completed and still requires a lot of work to be finalized. If this freaks you out, please stick around until a later, more stable version is released. Thanks!</p>
<h1 id="functionality">Functionality</h1>
<p>The goal of this tool is to eliminate the time it takes to prefix all of your CSS attributes by doing it for you as you type. Keep in mind that it does reformat the CSS attributes which are already inside a block element, but this shouldn't be too noticeable in most cases.</p>

<p>Works both for indented and single-line CSS styles. To activate it, just <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> into the workbench command window and type "Auto Prefix"</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>No special requirements.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not having a semicolon after an assigned attribute value provides no delimiter to distinguish between attributes. Improvisation code is limited, and for now simply places a semicolon where it should be for you.</li>
<li>Ambiguous attributes will not be checked, and will not be automatically revised.</li>
</ul>
