## Roadmap

- 0.8 - Automatically install and use npm packages
- 0.7 - Full node_modules support, merge imports and ability to organize

----

## Changelog

### 0.6.0

- Partial support for node_modules imports. AutoImport will scan your already used imports and provide them as suggestions when appropriate, so you will only need to type out your import once in one file and all other times will be handled by AutoImport. Version 0.7 will have full support for this.

### 0.5.1
- General improvements, icon added and extension will now also watch for local file changes.

----

## Todo

- Work with node_modules (@angular / underscore for example).
- Merge import statements
