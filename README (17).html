<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Git Graph View:
<ul>
<li>Display:
<ul>
<li>Local &amp; Remote Branches</li>
<li>Local Refs: Heads, Tags &amp; Remotes</li>
<li>Uncommitted Changes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perform Git Actions (available by right clicking on a commit / branch / tag):
<ul>
<li>Create, Checkout, Delete, Fetch, Merge, Pull, Push, Rebase, Rename &amp; Reset Branches</li>
<li>Add, Delete &amp; Push Tags</li>
<li>Checkout, Cherry Pick, Drop, Merge &amp; Revert Commits</li>
<li>Clean, Reset &amp; Stash Uncommitted Changes</li>
<li>Apply, Create Branch From, Drop &amp; Pop Stashes</li>
<li>View annotated tag details (name, email, date and message)</li>
<li>Copy commit hashes, and branch, stash &amp; tag names to the clipboard</li>
</ul></li>
<li>View commit details and file changes by clicking on a commit. On the Commit Details View you can:
<ul>
<li>View the Visual Studio Code Diff of any file change by clicking on it.</li>
<li>Open the current version of any file that was affected in the commit.</li>
<li>Copy the path of any file that was affected in the commit to the clipboard.</li>
<li>Click on any HTTP/HTTPS url in the commit body to open it in your default web browser.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compare any two commits by clicking on a commit, and then CTRL/CMD clicking on another commit. On the Commit Comparison View you can:
<ul>
<li>View the Visual Studio Code Diff of any file change between the selected commits by clicking on it.</li>
<li>Open the current version of any file that was affected between the selected commits.</li>
<li>Copy the path of any file that was affected between the selected commits to the clipboard.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Code Review - Keep track of which files you have reviewed in the Commit Details &amp; Comparison Views.
<ul>
<li>Code Review's can be performed on any commit, or between any two commits (not on Uncommitted Changes).</li>
<li>When a Code Review is started, all files needing to be reviewed are bolded. When you view the diff / open a file, it will then be un-bolded.</li>
<li>Code Reviews persist across Visual Studio Code sessions. They are automatically closed after 90 days of inactivity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>View uncommitted changes, and compare the uncommitted changes with any commit.</li>
<li>Hover over any commit vertex on the graph to see a tooltip indicating:
<ul>
<li>Whether the commit is included in the HEAD.</li>
<li>Which branches, tags and stashes include the commit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Filter the branches shown in Git Graph using the ‘Branches' dropdown menu. The options for filtering the branches are:
<ul>
<li>Show All branches</li>
<li>Select one or more branches to be viewed</li>
<li>Select from a user predefined array of custom glob patterns (by setting <code>git-graph.customBranchGlobPatterns</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fetch from Remote(s) <em>(available on the top control bar)</em></li>
<li>Find Widget allows you to quickly find one or more commits containing a specific phrase (in the commit message / date / author / hash, branch or tag names).</li>
<li>Repository Settings Widget:
<ul>
<li>Allows you to view, add, edit, delete, fetch &amp; prune remotes of the repository.</li>
<li>Configure "Issue Linking" - Converts issue numbers in commit messages into hyperlinks, that open the issue in your issue tracking system.</li>
<li>Configure "Pull Request Creation" - Automates the opening and pre-filling of a Pull Request form, directly from a branches context menu.
<ul>
<li>Support for the publicly hosted Bitbucket, GitHub and GitLab Pull Request providers is built-in.</li>
<li>Custom Pull Request providers can be configured using the Extension Setting <code>git-graph.customPullRequestProviders</code> (e.g. for use with privately hosted Pull Request providers). Information on how to configure custom providers is available <a href="https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph/wiki/Configuring-a-custom-Pull-Request-Provider">here</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Export your Git Graph Repository Configuration to a file that can be committed in the repository. It allows others working in the same repository to automatically use the same Git Graph configuration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keyboard Shortcuts (available in the Git Graph View):
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL/CMD + F</code>: Open the Find Widget.</li>
<li><code>CTRL/CMD + H</code>: Scrolls the Git Graph View to be centered on the commit referenced by HEAD.</li>
<li><code>CTRL/CMD + R</code>: Refresh the Git Graph View.</li>
<li><code>CTRL/CMD + S</code>: Scrolls the Git Graph View to the first (or next) stash in the loaded commits.</li>
<li><code>CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + S</code>: Scrolls the Git Graph View to the last (or previous) stash in the loaded commits.</li>
<li>When the Commit Details View is open on a commit:
<ul>
<li><code>Up</code> / <code>Down</code>: The Commit Details View will be opened on the commit directly above or below it on the Git Graph View.</li>
<li><code>CTRL/CMD + Up</code> / <code>CTRL/CMD + Down</code>: The Commit Details View will be opened on its child or parent commit on the same branch.
<ul>
<li>If the Shift Key is also pressed (i.e. <code>CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + Up</code> / <code>CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + Down</code>), when branches or merges are encountered the alternative branch is followed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Enter</code>: If a dialog is open, pressing enter submits the dialog, taking the primary (left) action.</li>
<li><code>Escape</code>: Closes the active dialog, context menu or the Commit Details View.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Resize the width of each column, and show/hide the Date, Author &amp; Commit columns.</li>
<li>Common Emoji Shortcodes are automatically replaced with the corresponding emoji in commit messages (including all <a href="https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/">gitmoji</a>). Custom Emoji Shortcode mappings can be defined in <code>git-graph.customEmojiShortcodeMappings</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A broad range of configurable settings (e.g. graph style, branch colours, and more…). See the ‘Extension Settings' section below for more information.</li>
