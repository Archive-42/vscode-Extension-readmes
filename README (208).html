<h1 id="click-7.0">click 7.0</h1>
<p><code>__init__.pyi</code> is almost a copy of <code>click/__init__.py</code>. It's a shortcut module anyway in the actual sources so it works well with minimal changes.</p>
<p>The types are pretty complete but they were created mostly for public API use so some internal modules (<code>_compat</code>) or functions (<code>core._bashcomplete</code>) are deliberately missing. If you feel the need to add those, pull requests accepted.</p>
<p>Speaking of pull requests, it would be great if the option decorators informed the type checker on what types the command callback should accept.</p>
