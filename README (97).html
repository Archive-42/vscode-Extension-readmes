<h2 id="extended-support-for-other-language-modes">Extended Support for Other Language Modes</h2>
<p>It's possible to specify which language modes will have autocompletion. There are three settings for this feature: * <code>html-css-class-completion.HTMLLanguages</code> is for language modes based on HTML, the ones you have the <code>class</code> attribute; * <code>html-css-class-completion.CSSLanguages</code> currently is for languages like CSS, Sass and Scss, this one is not very useful right now because it only supports the <code>@apply</code> function; * <code>html-css-class-completion.JavaScriptLanguages</code> is for JavaScript based languages supporting the <code>class</code> or <code>className</code> attribute.</p>
<p>The language modes listed in the previous section are already defined as default values in these settings, and you can add new ones or remove the already defined ones as necessary.</p>
<h2 id="specific-support">Specific Support</h2>
<ul>
<li>"<span class="citation" data-cites="apply">@apply</span>" directive in CSS, SASS and SCSS Files for <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>;</li>

<li>Emmet abbreviations support triggered by typing a "." (comes disabled by default, check the User Settings topic for more information).</li>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>If there are HTML or JS files on your workspace, the extension automatically starts and looks for CSS class definitions. In case new CSS classes are defined, or new CSS files are added to the workspace, and you also want auto-completion for them, just hit the lightning icon on the status bar. Also, you can execute the command by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code>(<code>Cmd+Shift+P</code> for Mac) and then typing "Cache CSS class definitions."</p>
<h3 id="more-user-settings">More User Settings</h3>
<p>The extension supports a few user settings, changes to these settings will be automatically recognized and the caching process will be re-executed.</p>
<h4 id="folders-and-files">Folders and Files</h4>
<p>You can change the folders and files the extension will consider or exclude during the caching process by setting the following user settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"html-css-class-completion.includeGlobPattern"</code> (default: <code>"**/*.{css,html}"</code>)</li>
<li><code>"html-css-class-completion.excludeGlobPattern"</code> (default: <code>""</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="emmet">Emmet</h4>
<p>Emmet support comes disabled by default, the reason behind this choice is because it the current implementation simply triggers completion when you type a "." (period) and this behavior might be considered a little annoying, but it might change in the future.</p>
<p>Currently it supports the following languages (those are <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers#_known-language-identifiers">language identifier</a>): "html", "razor", "php", "blade", "vue", "twig", "markdown", "erb", "handlebars", "ejs", "typescriptreact", "javascript", "javascriptreact".</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"html-css-class-completion.enableEmmetSupport"</code> (default: <code>false</code>)</li>
</ul>
