# Text Pastry for VS Code

Text Pastry lets you reduce repetitive work and use multiple cursors more effectively in VS Code.

This extension is based on the [Text Pastry extension for Sublime Text](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry). From their readme:

> If you're familiar with multiple selections, it's pretty straight forward. Place multiple cursors by using [alt+click], open the Command Palette and select Text Pastry From 1 to X. That's it! We've just pasted incrementing numbers.


## Features

The following commands are added to VS Code by this extension. The default keyboard shortcut to trigger the command pallet is cmd+shift+p

## Known Issues
