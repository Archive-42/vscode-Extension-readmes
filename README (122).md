I haven't figured out a way to implement that feature. If you've found a way please raise a PR!

Sure, you can request a button by creating a github issue here https://github.com/gorvgoyl/Shortcut-Menu-Bar-VSCode-Extension/issues

You can also make changes to [repo](https://github.com/gorvgoyl/Shortcut-Menu-Bar-VSCode-Extension/) and send me a PR to speed-up the process.

**How can I add buttons / Can I contribute to repo to add my button?**
